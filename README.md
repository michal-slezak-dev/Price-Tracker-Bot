# Price-Tracker-Bot (to be deployed)
TO DO: 
- ADD A MORE READABLE README.MD SO THAT IT'S EASIER TO RUN

 Bot that:
 1. sends a message with information about the current price of BTC, ETH and other cryptocurrencies
 2. responds with the amount of a cryptocurrency that can be bought for a particular amount of money (FIAT currency)
 3. responds with the amount of money that could be received after selling a particular amount of crypto
